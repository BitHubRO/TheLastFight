				"HOW DARE YOU?!", screams the gryphon. You know you are in trouble.
							   Engulfed by fear you say: 

						1. "I-I-I'm sorry didn't mean to wake you up..."
						2. "How dare YOU keep me locked in here?!"
						3. "What guardian would sleep when watching over a prisoner, 
						    did you think I wouldn't try to escape ?"
