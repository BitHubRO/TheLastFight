								Hello player!
						"The Last Fight" is a text-based adventure 
					   full of unexpected turns, different difficulty levels 
							and an intriguing experience. 
					   What lead to its creation was the interest and love 
							of the team for such games. 
					      We wanted to create an immersive experience. 
						     The team is formed by two students, 
						     Marian Elisei and Antonia Lutsch, 
					       of the Technical University of Cluj Napoca. 
							     Thank you for playing!
