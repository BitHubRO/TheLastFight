						Skeletons are the definition of not giving up. 
				     They have existed for so long that they observed any and all attacks. 
					Although because of their lack of muscles they can't always
						move out of the way fast enough they have time 
				   to contort their bodies so that the attack passes in between their bones 
							   allowing for minimum damage. 
					This grants the skeleton +2 protection during enemy attacks. 
							The skeleton starts off with 18 hp.
